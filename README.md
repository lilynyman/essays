Mary Cassatt's *Little Girl in a Blue Arm Chair* explores the authenticity and hilarious reality of child portraiture during the 19th century. The painting features a young girl, no older than seven or eight, slumped down in an grand, upholstered arm chair. She has pulled up her skirt in defiance and her lips are pursed in a pout. This is not the typical behavior of a young girl during this period, especially one from an affluent family. Cassatt deliberately chooses to offer a sincere, albeit laughable glimpse into the antics of a child who has been told to sit still for a portrait. From the girl's expression and pose to her wrinkled outfit, Cassatt portrays her subject exactly as she is, a mischievous little girl who refuses to listen.
